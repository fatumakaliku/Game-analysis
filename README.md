# **Unveiling Game Behavior: A Data-Driven Approach**

In the rapidly evolving world of gaming, understanding player behavior is crucial for enhancing user experience and driving engagement. This article presents an in-depth analysis of game data, revealing key insights into player behavior and performance.

## **1. Identifying New Players**

Our first insight focuses on players at Level 0. These players are typically new or inexperienced, and understanding their behavior can provide valuable information for player support and marketing efforts. Tailoring the game experience to these players can improve their engagement and retention.

## **2. Player Performance Under Specific Conditions**

The second insight delves into player performance under specific conditions - when `lives_earned` is 2 and at least 3 stages are crossed. Analyzing the average `Kill_Count` under these conditions can provide insights into player strategy and skill, informing game design and difficulty balancing.

## **3. Player Engagement and Device Performance**

The third insight examines the total number of stages crossed at each difficulty level for Level 2 players using `zm_series` devices. This analysis can help understand player engagement and device performance, guiding optimization efforts for both game mechanics and device compatibility.

## **4. Player Retention and Engagement Over Time**

Our fourth insight identifies players who have played games on multiple days. This metric is a strong indicator of player retention and engagement over time, providing a measure of the game's ability to keep players coming back.

## **5. Identifying Skilled Players**

The fifth insight finds players who have a `kill_count` greater than the average for Medium difficulty. These players can be considered skilled, and understanding their strategies and behaviors can inform game design to challenge and engage these players.

## **6. Player Survival Rates at Different Levels**

The sixth insight looks at the sum of lives earned at each level, excluding Level 0. This data can provide insights into player survival rates at different levels, informing game balance and difficulty progression.

## **7. Device Performance and Player Skill**

The seventh insight ranks the top 3 scores based on each `Dev_ID`. This ranking can help understand both device performance and player skill, providing a dual perspective on game interaction.

## **8. Device Usage Patterns**

The eighth insight identifies the `first_login` datetime for each device ID. This information can provide insights into device usage patterns, informing device optimization and compatibility efforts.

## **9. Player Performance Across Difficulty Levels**

The ninth insight ranks the top 5 scores based on each difficulty level. This ranking can help understand player performance across different difficulty levels, guiding game balance and difficulty design.

## **10. Player Device Preferences**

The tenth insight identifies the device ID that is first logged in for each player. This information can provide insights into player device preferences, informing device compatibility and optimization efforts.

## **11. Player Progress and Engagement**

The eleventh insight determines how many `kill_counts` were played by the player so far. This metric can help understand player progress and engagement, providing a measure of the game's ability to keep players engaged.

## **12. Player Progress Over Time**

The twelfth insight finds the cumulative sum of stages crossed over `start_datetime` for each `P_ID`, excluding the most recent `start_datetime`. This analysis can provide insights into player progress over time, informing game progression design.

## **13. Player Performance and Device Performance**

The thirteenth insight extracts the top 3 highest sums of scores for each `Dev_ID` and the corresponding `P_ID`. This data can help understand both player performance and device performance, providing a dual perspective on game interaction.

## **14. Identifying Above-Average Players**

The fourteenth insight identifies players who scored more than 50% of the average score. These players can be considered above-average, and understanding their strategies and behaviors can inform game design to challenge and engage these players.

## **15. Analyzing Player Performance**

The fifteenth insight creates a stored procedure to find the top `n` `headshots_count` based on each `Dev_ID`. This tool provides a reusable method for analyzing player performance, informing ongoing game balance and design efforts.

In conclusion, this data-driven approach provides valuable insights into player behavior, performance, and engagement. These insights can guide future strategies and decision-making processes in the gaming industry, driving improvements in game design, player support, and marketing efforts. The power of SQL in handling large datasets and the value of systematic analysis in deriving meaningful insights are clearly demonstrated through this project.
